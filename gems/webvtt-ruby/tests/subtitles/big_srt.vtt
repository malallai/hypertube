00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.306
That's interesting.

536
00:34:52.346 --> 00:34:54.744
- Hmm.
- She was a wonderful woman.

537
00:34:54.777 --> 00:34:57.814
Loved her some Jesus,
but had a bit

538
00:34:57.847 --> 00:35:00.811
of that Santeria
in her, you know?

539
00:35:00.844 --> 00:35:02.809
I always just thought
it was something

540
00:35:02.842 --> 00:35:05.051
for children to do,
keep 'em busy,

541
00:35:05.084 --> 00:35:09.520
tell them stories why
they're tying sticks together.

542
00:35:09.554 --> 00:35:12.292
SHERIFF TATE: Then that's all
we got on the Fontenot girl.

543
00:35:12.325 --> 00:35:14.292
COHLE: There was
nothing in there.

544
00:35:14.325 --> 00:35:16.828
Says, "Possible
report made in error."

545
00:35:16.861 --> 00:35:18.230
Now, that was 5 years ago.

546
00:35:18.263 --> 00:35:20.198
Ted Childress was
sheriff back then.

547
00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:22.699
He's set up in Gulf Shores
now, I think.

548
00:35:22.732 --> 00:35:25.169
HART: Ten-year-old girl goes missing
and that doesn't go state-wide?

549
00:35:25.202 --> 00:35:27.170
TATE: Now, hold on now.
My understanding,

550
00:35:27.203 --> 00:35:29.173
the little girl went off
with her birth daddy.

551
00:35:29.206 --> 00:35:31.212
Now, did you check
her mom's record?

552
00:35:31.245 --> 00:35:33.644
Possession, solicitation.

553
00:35:33.677 --> 00:35:36.284
I believe Ted knew the family,
and the feeling was

554
00:35:36.317 --> 00:35:38.284
the little girl was
better off with her daddy.

555
00:35:38.317 --> 00:35:41.083
Mom seemed to agree;
she filed a complaint,

556
00:35:41.116 --> 00:35:43.089
then never bothered
with it again,

557
00:35:43.122 --> 00:35:44.921
took off with her boyfriend.

558
00:35:44.954 --> 00:35:47.423
R&I said you had
a complaint these parts

559
00:35:47.456 --> 00:35:49.424
around December--
little girl

560
00:35:49.457 --> 00:35:51.424
getting chased
through the woods.

561
00:35:51.457 --> 00:35:54.598
TATE: Oh, yeah, I pulled
that one for you, too.

562
00:35:56.199 --> 00:35:58.291
[Sighs]

563
00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:04.305
What the hell is this?

564
00:36:04.338 --> 00:36:06.808
Little girl said
a green-eared spaghetti monster

565
00:36:06.842 --> 00:36:09.313
chased her through some woods.

566
00:36:09.346 --> 00:36:12.185
Now, we had her work
with a sketch artist,

567
00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:14.283
and she told us
that looked exactly right.

568
00:36:14.316 --> 00:36:18.460
Now, you want to call an APB
on that, you go right ahead.

569
00:36:18.493 --> 00:36:20.460
[Inhales deeply]
Listen, boys.

570
00:36:20.493 --> 00:36:22.595
I'm gonna have to call
a timeout, make a beer run.

571
00:36:22.628 --> 00:36:25.796
MAN: Well, why don't you hold
off on that for a while?

572
00:36:27.671 --> 00:36:30.639
COHLE: All right, well,
why don't you get it, then?

573
00:36:30.672 --> 00:36:33.141
We really don't want
to do that.

574
00:36:33.174 --> 00:36:36.642
Well, is this supposed
to be admissible? Huh?

575
00:36:36.675 --> 00:36:40.641
If you want to pick
my brain, work a room,

576
00:36:40.682 --> 00:36:43.816
you buy me a cheeseburger
and a Coke, don't you?

577
00:36:45.185 --> 00:36:47.682
I'll take a sixer
of Old Milwaukee

578
00:36:47.722 --> 00:36:49.722
or Lone Star, nothing snooty.

579
00:36:49.755 --> 00:36:52.089
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

580
00:36:52.122 --> 00:36:55.655
'Cause it's Thursday
and it's past noon.

581
00:36:55.688 --> 00:36:58.158
Thursday is one of my days off.

582
00:36:58.192 --> 00:37:01.666
On my off days, I start
drinking at noon.

583
00:37:01.699 --> 00:37:05.338
You don't get to
interrupt that.

584
00:37:12.249 --> 00:37:13.848
[Sighs]

585
00:37:19.627 --> 00:37:21.227
Ahem.

586
00:37:22.596 --> 00:37:24.596
I'd appreciate a little
hustle up on that.

587
00:37:24.636 --> 00:37:26.605

QUESADA VOICE-OVER: Yesterday,

at approximately 6 AM,

590
00:37:30.775 --> 00:37:34.247
civilians came across
the body of a female

591
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.748
in a sugar cane field
outside of Erath.

592
00:37:37.781 --> 00:37:40.548
Now, this person,
we believe, was murdered,

593
00:37:40.581 --> 00:37:43.249
and we are not yet in
a position to

594

- details of the crime.

Our investigators

have several leads,
and hopefully we'll--

598
00:37:53.934 --> 00:37:57.332
we'll have a suspect
for you in custody soon.

Now, this perpetrator

600
00:37:59.869 --> 00:38:02.341
will be apprehended,

00:38:07.414 --> 00:38:09.980
Let's talk about
your ex, Dora Lange.

604
00:38:10.013 --> 00:38:12.441
You want to talk Dori?

605
00:38:12.482 --> 00:38:14.850
What's she said I've done now?

606
00:38:14.883 --> 00:38:17.355
Nothing. We're just
curious if you knew

607
00:38:17.388 --> 00:38:19.891
what she's been up to and
maybe where she's living.

608
00:38:19.924 --> 00:38:21.491
CHARLIE: Nope.

609
00:38:21.524 --> 00:38:23.492
Got her divorce papers
pushed through

610
00:38:23.525 --> 00:38:25.492
after I been here about a year.

611
00:38:25.525 --> 00:38:28.026
I don't blame the bitch.

612
00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:29.994
She got a habit?

613
00:38:30.027 --> 00:38:32.500
[Chuckles]
Yeah, a few.

614
00:38:32.533 --> 00:38:34.970
Weed, meth, juice.

615
00:38:35.003 --> 00:38:36.676
Name it.

616
00:38:36.709 --> 00:38:38.371
HART: Charlie,

617
00:38:38.404 --> 00:38:39.842
how'd y'all meet?

618
00:38:39.875 --> 00:38:42.545
Growed up together,
dropped out the same time.

619
00:38:42.578 --> 00:38:45.180
Hitched up way too quick.

620
00:38:45.213 --> 00:38:48.514
You know how it is-- you want
a wife, but only half the time.

621
00:38:48.547 --> 00:38:49.986
Hmm.

622
00:38:50.019 --> 00:38:52.493
Why are you saying
you hadn't heard from her?

623
00:38:52.526 --> 00:38:55.727
She called up here
for you not too long ago.

624
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.800
She couldn't help me
anyway, man.

625
00:38:57.833 --> 00:38:59.737
She sounded all fucked up.

626
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.738
You see, that's exactly
the kind of thing

627
00:39:01.771 --> 00:39:03.769
that we do want to know
about, though, Charlie.

628
00:39:03.802 --> 00:39:05.335
Oh. All right.

629
00:39:05.368 --> 00:39:08.409
Uh... I needed
some scratch for my store,

630
00:39:08.442 --> 00:39:11.542
and Dori owes me money,
she ain't got no fuckin' phone,

631
00:39:11.575 --> 00:39:14.183
so got a number to
her friend Carla, got her

632
00:39:14.216 --> 00:39:17.186
to call me back, and she ain't
made no fuckin' sense.

name and phone number.

634
00:39:21.027 --> 00:39:23.922
COHLE: What you mean,
she didn't make sense?

635
00:39:23.963 --> 00:39:27.025
Like she could duck-hunt
with a rake.

636
00:39:27.066 --> 00:39:29.463
High, yeah.

Talkin' 'bout
she's gonna become a nun.

- Why a nun?
- I don't know, man. She was high.

639

talkin' 'bout...
she met a king.

00:39:45.648 --> 00:39:47.785
I don't need no
snitch jacket up in here.

Aryan Nation here.

case through or just the end?

No, whole story

656
00:40:35.365 --> 00:40:36.731
from your end, you don't mind.

What he didn't say is that this
is about something else.

Something new. That one
in Lake Charles, maybe?

661
00:40:52.514 --> 00:40:54.153
Now, why you say that?

662
00:40:54.186 --> 00:40:56.690
Get the details
out of the paper.

00:40:56.723 --> 00:40:58.661

with what we got.

00:43:15.018 --> 00:43:17.984
Well, I tried to tell her
you aren't big on socializing.

709
00:43:18.017 --> 00:43:19.486
I said that your life's

710
00:43:19.519 --> 00:43:21.453
in this man's hands, right?

711
00:43:21.486 --> 00:43:23.925
Of course you should
meet the family.

712
00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:27.927
Well, not quite
as dramatic as that, hon.

713
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.496
I've never fired my gun.

714
00:43:30.529 --> 00:43:32.537
Have you fired your gun?

715
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.833
Audrey.

716
00:43:37.705 --> 00:43:39.143
Yes.

717
00:43:39.176 --> 00:43:41.007
You shot people?

718
00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.345
Macie.

719
00:43:42.378 --> 00:43:43.849
Ahem.

720
00:43:43.883 --> 00:43:46.351
Dad's never shot anybody.

721
00:43:46.384 --> 00:43:49.485
COHLE:
Well, that's good.

722
00:43:49.518 --> 00:43:51.382
You don't want to shoot people.

723
00:43:51.415 --> 00:43:53.150
But you have.

724
00:43:54.823 --> 00:43:57.294
Marty says you're from Texas.

725
00:43:57.327 --> 00:43:59.793
Yes, south Texas.

726
00:43:59.834 --> 00:44:03.267
COHLE: I grew up in Alaska.

727
00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.033
Just been working here
the last 10, 12 years.

728
00:44:06.066 --> 00:44:08.041
What kind of work?

729
00:44:08.074 --> 00:44:10.842
Narcotics, mostly.

730
00:44:10.875 --> 00:44:12.810
Um...

731
00:44:12.843 --> 00:44:16.350
was on the Robbery Squad
in Houston until '89.

732
00:44:16.383 --> 00:44:20.190
[Pager buzzing]
Ahem. Oh. Be right back.

733
00:44:20.223 --> 00:44:22.326
Y'all keep eating.

734
00:44:26.696 --> 00:44:29.333
Do you like your job?

735
00:44:32.229 --> 00:44:34.404
Not exactly,

736
00:44:34.437 --> 00:44:36.605
but it's worthwhile.

737
00:44:36.638 --> 00:44:38.604
I'm good at it.

738
00:44:38.637 --> 00:44:40.739
You're not married?

739
00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.076
Once.

740
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:46.582
- Uh, not anymore.
- Mm-hmm.

741
00:44:46.615 --> 00:44:50.021
Did you do this
while you were married?

742
00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:51.989
Hey, Chris.

743
00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:54.988
Hey, thanks for the page.

744
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:58.024
Yeah, well,
he'll appreciate it.

745
00:44:58.057 --> 00:45:00.518
Well-- all right,

746
00:45:00.559 --> 00:45:03.254
then I appreciate it.

747
00:45:03.295 --> 00:45:05.389
[Whispers]

748
00:45:09.764 --> 00:45:11.699
- [Girls giggle]
- Children?

749
00:45:11.732 --> 00:45:14.197
One.

750
00:45:14.238 --> 00:45:16.672
She passed.

751
00:45:16.705 --> 00:45:20.348
Marriage didn't last
long after that.

752
00:45:22.254 --> 00:45:24.351
Sorry.

753
00:45:26.225 --> 00:45:28.793
HART: Ahem. Chris Demma's
on the phone for you.

754
00:45:28.826 --> 00:45:31.991
Something about a CI or...

755
00:45:32.032 --> 00:45:34.465
Back there to the left.

756
00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:36.466
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

757
00:45:40.703 --> 00:45:42.809
Ahem.

758
00:45:48.216 --> 00:45:50.143
What was that?

759
00:45:50.184 --> 00:45:52.185
What were y'all talking about?

760
00:45:52.218 --> 00:45:54.154
Your job.

761
00:45:54.187 --> 00:45:56.921
What do you know
about him, Marty?

762
00:45:59.827 --> 00:46:02.269
Um, not a lot.

763
00:46:02.302 --> 00:46:04.764
He could be a good detective.

764
00:46:04.805 --> 00:46:08.303
He's running on this
thing, but, uh...

765
00:46:08.344 --> 00:46:09.807
uppity.

766
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.312
[Scoffs]

767
00:46:11.345 --> 00:46:13.282
What?

768
00:46:13.315 --> 00:46:17.253
Jeez. Have you ever
asked him about himself?

769
00:46:18.657 --> 00:46:20.594
Baby, trust me.

770
00:46:20.635 --> 00:46:23.772
You do not want to pick
this man's brain.

771
00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.607
What was that?

772
00:46:29.648 --> 00:46:33.279
Oh, some details
on the CI. Ahem.

773
00:46:36.584 --> 00:46:39.225
Thank you for dinner, Maggie.

774
00:46:39.258 --> 00:46:42.058
- This looks great.
- My pleasure.

775
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:44.056
AUDREY: I don't like
that broccoli.

776
00:46:44.097 --> 00:46:45.591
MAGGIE:
Mind your manners.

777
00:46:45.632 --> 00:46:48.662
So you, uh, need to go or what?

778
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:52.997
No, it's nothing can't
wait till tomorrow.

779
00:46:54.364 --> 00:46:58.635
MAGGIE: Rust, uh, what
you were saying before?

780
00:47:01.509 --> 00:47:04.708
Oh, we can find something
nicer to talk about.

781
00:47:04.741 --> 00:47:08.182
Marty, I saw
your table in there.

782
00:47:08.215 --> 00:47:10.014
You fly-fish?

783
00:47:10.055 --> 00:47:12.153
Little bit.

784
00:47:13.592 --> 00:47:17.623
MAN VOICE-OVER: So you
and Cohle went bad in '02, huh?

785
00:47:17.664 --> 00:47:19.926
Heard about that.

786
00:47:19.959 --> 00:47:23.265
Yeah, well... what happened
between me and him

787
00:47:23.299 --> 00:47:27.273
don't have nothing to do
with Dora Lange.

788
00:47:28.642 --> 00:47:31.642
I worked with Rust Cohle
for 7 years.

789
00:47:31.675 --> 00:47:33.642
People change.

790
00:47:33.683 --> 00:47:36.914
Relationships change.

791
00:47:36.947 --> 00:47:39.420
You stay in touch?

792
00:47:39.453 --> 00:47:41.891
No.

793
00:47:41.924 --> 00:47:45.923
No, I haven't talked
to Rust in...

794
00:47:45.957 --> 00:47:48.431
10 years.

795
00:47:48.464 --> 00:47:50.632
Yeah.

796
00:47:53.105 --> 00:47:55.544
HART: Look, however we...

797
00:47:55.577 --> 00:47:58.541
he was a good detective,

798
00:47:58.574 --> 00:48:02.543
and it don't matter how
he ended it. I mean...

799
00:48:02.584 --> 00:48:06.586
I can say that
because it's the truth,

800
00:48:06.619 --> 00:48:09.258
and I don't hold grudges.

801
00:48:09.292 --> 00:48:11.926
I believe that's the shit

802
00:48:11.967 --> 00:48:14.735
that leads to cancer.

803
00:48:17.104 --> 00:48:18.568
[Scoffs]

804
00:48:18.609 --> 00:48:21.573
But why am I talking
about dinner?

805
00:48:21.606 --> 00:48:26.248
Y'all want to walk through
the Lange case, fine.

806
00:48:28.115 --> 00:48:31.924
This other stuff--
well, what's going on?

807
00:48:31.957 --> 00:48:34.826
Sorry. We just heard
some stories.

808
00:48:34.859 --> 00:48:36.858
MAN: Well, personally,
I heard he was

809
00:48:36.891 --> 00:48:39.061
an ace case man, right?

810
00:48:39.102 --> 00:48:42.236
I'd like to understand
his process.

811
00:48:44.866 --> 00:48:46.833
"His process."

812
00:48:46.866 --> 00:48:48.474
Sure.

813
00:48:49.908 --> 00:48:51.980
FAVRE: The other landlord
says she trashed the place,

814
00:48:52.013 --> 00:48:53.979
so she lost her deposit.

815
00:48:54.012 --> 00:48:55.979
And the neighbors check out.

816
00:48:56.012 --> 00:48:58.485
Those that remember her
said that she, uh,

817
00:48:58.518 --> 00:49:00.990
used to come in early
in the morning,

818
00:49:01.023 --> 00:49:03.991
if she came home at all.

819
00:49:04.024 --> 00:49:05.991
[Sniffs]

820
00:49:06.024 --> 00:49:09.168
You guys canvass the bars
pretty good today?

821
00:49:11.665 --> 00:49:14.137
GERACI: You know,
up your ass, Cohle.

822
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:16.170
Why don't you do your
own fuckin' leg work,

823
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.305
you rat fuck?

824
00:49:22.883 --> 00:49:24.546
Say it again, rummy.

825
00:49:24.579 --> 00:49:26.554
HART: Hey.

826
00:49:26.587 --> 00:49:28.682
[Chuckling]

827
00:49:30.052 --> 00:49:32.061
You know what, man?

828
00:49:32.093 --> 00:49:34.227
Fuck you,

829
00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.363
Tax Man.

830
00:49:39.903 --> 00:49:41.837
What the fuck?

831
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:44.544
LUTZ: Ahem.
Back to point.

832
00:49:44.576 --> 00:49:46.544
Got 3 hits on working girls.

833
00:49:46.577 --> 00:49:49.048
No one close to her, naturally.

834
00:49:49.081 --> 00:49:52.414
A few names recognized
her as occasional.

835
00:49:52.448 --> 00:49:54.415
DEMMA: Like she tricked
now and then, show up

836
00:49:54.448 --> 00:49:57.225
at a couple of truck stops
when she needed cash.

837
00:49:57.258 --> 00:49:59.289
You got some names.
Which ones?

838
00:49:59.322 --> 00:50:02.793
I heard from my AP guy,
Ray Fontenot.

839
00:50:02.826 --> 00:50:05.330
Said her uncle's
Danny Fontenot--

840
00:50:05.363 --> 00:50:06.866
the pitcher, LSU.

841
00:50:06.899 --> 00:50:09.834
Yeah, I watched him
play. Great player.

842
00:50:09.867 --> 00:50:12.403
LUTZ: - Well, he lives close by.
- Ahem.

843
00:50:12.444 --> 00:50:14.539
Well, thanks, guys.

844
00:50:14.572 --> 00:50:17.042
QUESADA: What about you two?
Did you get anything today?

845
00:50:17.075 --> 00:50:20.079
- Not much, sir.
- Well...

846
00:50:20.112 --> 00:50:22.911
You might know
the Reverend Tuttle.

847
00:50:22.944 --> 00:50:25.079
He runs our state-wide
charity drive.

848
00:50:25.112 --> 00:50:27.088
This is Detective Hart,
Detective Cohle.

849
00:50:27.121 --> 00:50:28.583
Pleasure to meet you, Officers.

850
00:50:28.616 --> 00:50:30.086
Nice to meet you.
Cohle.

851
00:50:30.119 --> 00:50:33.086
Your case has a lot
of people taking care,

852
00:50:33.119 --> 00:50:36.126
doors locking where
they used to not.

853
00:50:36.159 --> 00:50:38.092
Eddie's been speaking
to me about it.

854
00:50:38.125 --> 00:50:39.794
Concerned, very concerned.

855
00:50:39.827 --> 00:50:42.566
SPEECE: We've been discussing
the viability of a task force

856
00:50:42.599 --> 00:50:45.071
to investigate crimes with
an anti-Christian connotation.

857
00:50:45.104 --> 00:50:47.905
COHLE: You what?
Really?

858
00:50:50.307 --> 00:50:51.914
Yes.

859
00:50:54.686 --> 00:50:58.221
I don't mean to tell men
of your positions,

860
00:50:58.254 --> 00:51:01.925
but there is a war
happening behind things.

861
00:51:03.694 --> 00:51:05.858
Thank you for doing your part.

862
00:51:05.891 --> 00:51:08.098
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

863
00:51:08.995 --> 00:51:11.432
Well...

864
00:51:11.465 --> 00:51:14.433
Eddie's going to be
very, very pleased

865
00:51:14.466 --> 00:51:17.602
to have such good men
working on this.

866
00:51:20.107 --> 00:51:22.579
Are you kidding me?

867
00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:25.083
Un-fuckin'-believable.

868
00:51:25.116 --> 00:51:27.549
"Anti-Christian."

869
00:51:27.582 --> 00:51:30.917
Fucks. And who
the fuck's Eddie?

870
00:51:30.958 --> 00:51:32.221
Huh?

871
00:51:33.624 --> 00:51:35.064
Is he serious?

872
00:51:35.097 --> 00:51:37.032
HART: Well, he doesn't
have a television.

873
00:51:37.065 --> 00:51:38.999
COHLE: - Who's Eddie?
- And he's from Texas.

874
00:51:39.032 --> 00:51:40.965
He's the fuckin'
governor--

875
00:51:40.998 --> 00:51:42.966
- Edwin Tuttle.
- Ah.

876
00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:45.009
They're first cousins.

877
00:51:45.042 --> 00:51:46.474
Well, that makes sense.

878
00:51:46.507 --> 00:51:48.473
DEMMA: Yeah, that's the
sound of The Big Machine,

879
00:51:48.514 --> 00:51:50.840
Cohle, that's gearing up
to pound your ass.

880
00:51:50.881 --> 00:51:52.080
Heh!

881
00:51:52.113 --> 00:51:54.249
The sound of a gaggle of hens.

882
00:51:54.282 --> 00:51:56.249
Yeah, you better
watch your mouth

883
00:51:56.282 --> 00:51:58.554
or they're gonna
peck your eyes out.

884
00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:01.551
- Hi.
- Hi.

885
00:52:01.592 --> 00:52:03.719
I am looking for
Detective Hart.

886
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.929
I have a stack of
